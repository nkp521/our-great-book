# Chapter 1

There's quite a bit of information on this page; we'll cover a few of the most helpful things:

    At the top of the page, note that the "Pull requests" tab is active. This is where you can go to see all the open (i.e., not yet merged) pull requests.

    Below that, there is a second set of tabs in which the "Conversation" tab is currently active. This is where you can see the overview of the pull request, as well as any comments that have been added.

    Another helpful source of information in this area is the "Files changed" tab. You can go here to see exactly which files have been changed as well as the diff for each file. In our case, there's only one file and all we did was add a bunch of content to it, so the information isn't very helpful. We'll see an example of a more informative diff a bit later.

    Here GitHub tells you whether or not the PR can be merged. If there are merge conflicts, there will be information about how to resolve those conflicts. We'll see an example of that later as well.
